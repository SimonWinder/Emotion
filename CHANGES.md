# Architecture Changes - October 19, 2025

## Summary

The model architecture has been updated to match a simpler TensorFlow specification, converted to PyTorch. This document details all changes made to the codebase.

## What Changed

### 1. Model Architecture (`model.py`)

**Before:**
- 4 convolutional blocks with BatchNorm
- Conv channels: 64 → 128 → 256 → 512
- 2 FC layers: 512 → 256 → 4
- Dropout: 0.5
- ~4.4M parameters

**After:**
- 2 convolutional layers (no BatchNorm)
- Conv channels: 16 → 32
- 1 FC layer: 32 → 4
- No dropout
- ~595K parameters (87% reduction)

**Key Differences:**
- Replaced ReLU with LeakyReLU (negative_slope=0.1)
- Removed BatchNormalization layers
- Removed Dropout layers
- Simplified architecture with fewer layers

### 2. Configuration (`config.py`)

**Changes:**
```python
# Before
IMAGE_SIZE = 64
CONV_CHANNELS = [64, 128, 256, 512]
FC_HIDDEN_SIZE = 512
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.5

# After
IMAGE_SIZE = 48
CONV_CHANNELS = [16, 32]
FC_HIDDEN_SIZE = 32
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.0
```

### 3. Other Files

**No changes needed for:**
- `train.py` - Works with any model that follows the same interface
- `evaluate.py` - Model-agnostic evaluation
- `predict.py` - Uses model's forward pass
- `dataset.py` - Adapts to IMAGE_SIZE from config
- `utils.py` - Helper functions remain the same

## TensorFlow to PyTorch Conversion

### Key Translation Points

1. **Data Format**
   ```python
   # TensorFlow: (batch, height, width, channels)
   # PyTorch:    (batch, channels, height, width)
   ```

2. **Padding**
   ```python
   # TensorFlow: padding='same'
   # PyTorch:    padding=1 (for kernel_size=3)
   ```

3. **Activation Functions**
   ```python
   # TensorFlow: model.add(LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.1))
   # PyTorch:    self.leaky_relu = nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.1)
   ```

4. **Softmax Handling**
   ```python
   # TensorFlow: Explicit softmax in model
   # PyTorch:    Softmax in CrossEntropyLoss
   ```

5. **Weight Initialization**
   ```python
   # Added Kaiming initialization for LeakyReLU
   nn.init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight, mode='fan_out',
                           nonlinearity='leaky_relu', a=0.1)
   ```

## Testing Results

### Model Creation Test
```bash
$ p3 model.py

EmotionCNN (Simplified Architecture)
  Input: (3, 48, 48)
  Total parameters: 595,076

✓ Model creation successful
✓ Forward pass successful
✓ Output shape correct: (batch, 4)
✓ Softmax probabilities sum to 1.0
```

### Dataset Loading Test
```bash
$ p3 dataset.py

Training set: 14,445 images
Validation set: 4,922 images
Test set: 128 images

✓ All images loaded successfully
✓ Batch shape: (64, 3, 48, 48)
✓ Image range normalized correctly
```

## Benefits of New Architecture

### 1. Performance
- **Faster training**: 7.4x fewer parameters to update
- **Faster inference**: Simpler forward pass
- **Lower memory**: Fits easily in GPU memory

### 2. Efficiency
- **Smaller model files**: 2.3 MB vs 17 MB
- **Quicker loading**: Less data to load from disk
- **Better for deployment**: Easier to deploy on edge devices

### 3. Compatibility
- **Matches baseline**: Direct comparison with TensorFlow implementation
- **Reproducible**: Follows exact specification provided

### 4. Training
- **Less overfitting risk**: Simpler model with no dropout
- **Faster convergence**: Fewer parameters to optimize
- **Lower computational cost**: Can train on CPU if needed

## Expected Impact on Results

### Accuracy
- May be **slightly lower** than complex model initially
- Trade-off: simplicity vs capacity
- Target: Still ≥85% on test set

### Training Time
- **Much faster** per epoch (~7x speedup expected)
- May need more epochs to converge
- Overall training time likely similar or faster

### Overfitting
- **Less likely** due to simpler architecture
- No dropout needed
- LeakyReLU helps with gradient flow

## Migration Guide

### For Training
No changes needed! Just run:
```bash
p3 train.py
```

The training script automatically uses the new architecture from `model.py` and new settings from `config.py`.

### For Evaluation
```bash
p3 evaluate.py
```

Works the same way - loads model checkpoint and evaluates.

### For Prediction
```bash
p3 predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg --visualize
```

No changes to prediction interface.

### For Custom Code

If you have custom code using the old model:

**Old:**
```python
from model import EmotionCNN
model = EmotionCNN(dropout_rate=0.5)  # Old signature
```

**New:**
```python
from model import EmotionCNN
model = EmotionCNN()  # Dropout removed from constructor
# or
model = EmotionCNN(input_channels=3, num_classes=4)
```

## Backwards Compatibility

⚠️ **Note**: Models trained with the old architecture cannot be loaded with the new architecture due to different layer structures.

If you have old model checkpoints:
1. Keep the old `model.py` in a separate file
2. Load with old architecture
3. Re-train with new architecture if needed

   - Check if 50 epochs is sufficient
   - Adjust learning rate if needed
   - Watch for overfitting (though less likely now)

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is the model smaller?**
A: Matching a simpler baseline architecture from TensorFlow for comparison and faster training.

**Q: Will accuracy be lower?**
A: Possibly, but the goal is ≥85% which should still be achievable with proper training.

**Q: Can I still use the old model?**
A: Yes, but you need to keep the old `model.py` separately. The checkpoint files are not compatible.

**Q: Why LeakyReLU instead of ReLU?**
A: That's what the specification requires. LeakyReLU can help prevent "dying ReLU" problem.

**Q: Why no dropout?**
A: The simpler architecture is less prone to overfitting, and the specification didn't include dropout.

**Q: Can I modify the architecture?**
A: Yes! Edit `model.py` and `config.py`. The current implementation matches the requirement, but you can experiment.
